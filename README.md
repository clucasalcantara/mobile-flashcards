Below you'll find information about what is this app is and how to run.

## Available Scripts

This project was tested in a iPhone X physical device, an iPhone 6 and iPhone 7, all with expo.

Also you can run in both iOS and Android simulators.

`npm start`
For Simulators, runs in CLI mode and displays messages on console to allow you to run your app
run this command and choose `i` or `a` as your option.


#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run android`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for detailed setup). We also recommend installing Genymotion as your Android emulator.
